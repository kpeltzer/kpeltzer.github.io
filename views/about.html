Between writing short superhero stories on crude word processors to long games of Wolfenstein 3D, a hobby soon developed which has since not only flourished but has also turned into my bread and butter. I currently work at Thrillist Media Group where I am involved in nearly every portion of the website stack.</p><p>In previous lives, I worked at Solvate as an engineer helping freelancers make their wallets extra fat, and at Prolifics helping develop massive financial applications as a consultant.</p><p>I tend to enjoy some of the finer things in life.</p><ul><li>Garbage Plates</li><li>Listening to my headphones too loud</li><li>Beautiful women on the subway reading the New Yorker</li><li>The 1992 Buffalo Bills</li><li><a class="about" href="http://www.geneseebeer.com">Fresh, unfiltered Genesee River water</a> from my hometown of Rochester, NY</li></ul><p>However, when not busy with the above, I also love to work on random projects in any combination of Javascript, Ruby, or PHP.</p><p>Feel free to contact me at ken at kenpeltzer dot com.</p></div></div>
